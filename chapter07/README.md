# GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS) Tutorial

GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS) is a suite of tools designed to improve the security posture of your codebases hosted on GitHub. GHAS helps in identifying, managing, and mitigating security risks throughout the software development lifecycle. This tutorial will guide you through the key features of GHAS and show you how to use them effectively.

GitHub provides a suite of code security and analysis features designed to help developers identify and fix vulnerabilities, maintain code quality, and ensure their projects are secure. This tutorial will guide you through using these features to enhance the security and quality of your code.

## Prerequisites
- A GitHub account
- Access to a repository where you have admin rights (GHAS features are available for GitHub Enterprise and GitHub.com under specific plans)

## Step 1: Enabling GitHub Dependabot
Dependabot scans your dependencies for known vulnerabilities and automatically opens pull requests to update them to a secure version.

1. **Navigate to Your Repository Settings:**
   Go to your GitHub repository, click on "Settings" > "Security & analysis" on the left sidebar.

2. **Enable Dependabot Alerts and Security Updates:**
   In the "Security & analysis" section, find "Dependabot alerts" and "Dependabot security updates". Ensure both are enabled to allow GitHub to notify you of vulnerabilities and automatically generate pull requests to address them.

## Step 2: Configuring Code Scanning
GitHub's code scanning tools scan your code for security vulnerabilities and errors.

1. **Set Up Code Scanning:**
   Still in the "Security & analysis" settings, locate "Code scanning alerts" and click on "Set up code scanning".

2. **Choose a Code Scanning Tool:**
   GitHub recommends using CodeQL, but you can choose from other available tools. Follow the setup instructions provided by GitHub for your selected tool.

3. **Start the Scan:**
   Commit the code scanning configuration file to your repository. GitHub will automatically start scanning your code on every push and pull request, depending on your configuration.

## Step 3: Dependency Review
Dependency review helps you review your project's dependencies for known vulnerabilities when you open a pull request.
1. This feature is automatically enabled with GHAS.
2. When opening or reviewing a pull request, check the "Files changed" tab for a dependency review report.


  
## Step 4: Utilizing Dependency Insights
1. **Dependency Graph:** 
    Ensure the Dependency Graph is enabled in your repository's settings to track dependencies.
2. **View Dependency Alerts:**
    Check the "Security" tab for any alerts related to your dependencies. Update or replace vulnerable dependencies as recommended.


## Step 5: Reviewing and Fixing Alerts
1. **Review Alerts:**
   To see the security alerts generated by Dependabot and code scanning, go to the "Security" tab in your repository. Here, you'll find details about each vulnerability, including its severity, affected files, and suggestions for remediation.

2. **Fix Vulnerabilities:**
   - For Dependabot alerts, you can often merge the automatically created pull requests to update vulnerable dependencies.
   - For code scanning alerts, review the suggested fixes and implement the necessary changes in your code. Once resolved, commit your changes to close the alerts.

## Step 6: Utilizing Secret Scanning
Secret scanning prevents accidental exposure of confidential information, like API keys and tokens.

1. **Enable Secret Scanning:**
   In the "Security & analysis" settings, ensure "Secret scanning" is enabled.

2. **Review and Resolve Alerts:**
   If secret scanning identifies exposed secrets, you'll receive an alert. Review these alerts and follow GitHub's guidance to rotate the secrets and update your code or settings as necessary.

## Step 7: Applying Advanced Security Features
For teams with GitHub Advanced Security, further features like push protection and security overview are available.

1. **Configure Advanced Settings:**
   Explore additional settings under "Security & analysis" to customize security policies, review permissions, and set up push protections.

2. **Leverage Security Overview:**
   Use the "Security" tab's overview section to monitor your repository's overall security posture, track progress in addressing vulnerabilities, and prioritize security tasks.
