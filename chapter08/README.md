# GitHub Copilot Command Line Interface

`gh` is GitHub on the command line. It brings pull requests, issues, and other GitHub concepts to the terminal next to where you are already working with `git` and your code.

The `gh-copilot` CLI extension brings the power of GitHub Copilot directly to your terminal, allowing you to generate code, comments, and even entire functions quickly through the command line interface.
