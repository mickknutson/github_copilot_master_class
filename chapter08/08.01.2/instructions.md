## Prerequisites

- **GitHub Account**: Ensure you have a GitHub account. If you don't, sign up at [github.com](https://github.com/).
- **Node.js and npm**: GitHub Copilot CLI requires Node.js (version 12 or later) and npm (Node Package Manager). You can download Node.js, which includes npm, from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Step 1: Install GitHub Copilot CLI

1. **Open your terminal**.
2. **Install the GitHub Copilot CLI globally** by running the following npm command:

   ```sh
   npm install -g @github/copilot-cli
   ```

   This command installs the GitHub Copilot CLI globally on your system, making it accessible from any directory.

3. **Verify Installation:** Confirm that Copilot CLI has been installed successfully by checking its version:
   ```
   copilot --version
   ```

## Step 2: Authenticate with GitHub

1. **Authenticate the CLI with your GitHub account**. After installation, you need to authenticate the CLI to access GitHub Copilot. Run:

   ```sh
   copilot auth login
   ```

2. A **web browser will open** asking you to log in to your GitHub account and authorize the GitHub Copilot CLI. Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the authentication process.



## Step 3: Working in a Session

1. **To start a new Copilot session**:

    ```bash
    copilot session start
    ```

2. **Stop the Session**
    
    When you're done, you can end the session by running:

    ```bash
    copilot session stop
    ```

    This command terminates the current Copilot session.

## Step 4: Generate Code with GitHub Copilot CLI

Now that you have installed and authenticated GitHub Copilot CLI, you can start generating code. Here's how to use it:

### Generating Code

1. **Navigate to your project directory** in the terminal where you want to generate code.

2. **run the copilot command**, you can use the `copilot generate` command followed by a prompt. For example:

    ```bash
    copilot generate "Write a function in JavaScript to add two numbers"
    ```

    Copilot will provide you with a code snippet based on your prompt.


### Specifying code language

1. **Navigate to your project directory** in the terminal where you want to generate code.

2. **Run the Copilot command** to start generating code. For example, to get a suggestion for a Python function, you might use:

   ```sh
   copilot generate --lang python "def add_numbers(a, b):"
   ```

   Replace `"def add_numbers(a, b):"` with whatever prompt you wish to use. The `--lang` flag specifies the programming language.


### Advanced Usage

GitHub Copilot CLI offers advanced features, including setting preferences for programming languages, frameworks, and more.

- **File Context**: You can provide a file as context for the code generation by using the `--file` option. This allows Copilot to generate code that is consistent with the rest of your file.

    ```bash
    copilot generate "add a function to parse JSON" --file path/to/yourfile.js
    ```

- **Language Specification**: You can specify the programming language for your code generation using the `--lang` option.

    ```bash
    copilot generate "generate a SQL query to select everything from a table" --lang sql
    ```

- **Ask Questions**

    You can ask specific programming questions or request code examples. For example:

    ```bash
    copilot ask "How do I reverse a string in Python?"
    ```
    Copilot will respond with code snippets or explanations based on your query.

### Navigating Features:

1. **Start a New Copilot Session:** Begin by starting a new Copilot session with a specific file or project:
   ```
   copilot edit filename.js
   ```
   This will open the specified file in your default editor with Copilot suggestions enabled.

2. **Use Copilot in Your Terminal:** For quick commands or code snippets, use:
   ```
   copilot run "your command here"
   ```
   Copilot will execute the command or generate code snippets based on your input.

## Step 4: Use Additional Commands

- **Get help**: To see all available commands and options, use:

  ```sh
  copilot --help
  ```

- **Customize suggestions**: You can customize the suggestions by using additional flags such as `--lang` for specifying the language, and `--context` to provide more context to the Copilot for better suggestions.

## Step 5: Updating GitHub Copilot CLI

To update the GitHub Copilot CLI to the latest version, run:

```sh
npm update -g @github/copilot-cli
```

---
## Troubleshooting Advice:

- **Common Errors:** If you encounter permission errors during installation, try prefixing the install command with `sudo` (for Linux/Mac) or run the command prompt as an administrator (for Windows).

- **Connectivity Issues:** Ensure your internet connection is stable during installation and authentication processes.

- **Authentication Problems:** If you're having trouble authenticating, double-check your GitHub credentials and ensure you have authorized Copilot CLI in your GitHub account settings.

Following these steps and advice should help you successfully install and use the Github Copilot CLI, enhancing your coding experience with AI-powered assistance.

## Conclusion

You've now learned how to install, authenticate, and start generating code with GitHub Copilot CLI. This tool can significantly boost your productivity by providing code suggestions directly in your terminal. Explore the `--help` command to discover more ways to use GitHub Copilot CLI in your development workflow. Remember, while GitHub Copilot can be incredibly helpful, always review the generated code to ensure it meets your requirements and adheres to best practices.
