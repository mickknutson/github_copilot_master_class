# Data Exercises

The following are instructions for exercise 

## Outline
This exercise contains two directories:
- `lab` contains starter files if any are needed. Might be empty. This is the directory you should perform all your work in. The project and files might not run, and might fail compilation until the lab has been completed. _(See instructions below)_

- `solution` contains completed, and runnable files. Do not perform work in this directory.
