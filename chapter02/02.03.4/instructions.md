# Creating a Jupyter Notebook in Visual Studio Code with GitHub Copilot

This tutorial guides you through the process of creating a Jupyter Notebook in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) using GitHub Copilot. Follow these steps for a seamless setup.

## Prerequisites

- Visual Studio Code
- Python extension for VS Code
- Jupyter extension for VS Code
- GitHub Copilot (optional but recommended)

## Step 1: Install Visual Studio Code

Ensure VS Code is installed on your computer. If not, download it from [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and follow the installation instructions.

## Step 2: Install Python Extension

1. Open VS Code.
2. Navigate to the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X` or `Cmd+Shift+X` on macOS).
3. Search for `Python` and install the extension provided by Microsoft.

## Step 3: Install Jupyter Extension

1. In the Extensions view, search for `Jupyter`.
2. Install the Jupyter extension provided by Microsoft.

## Step 4: Install GitHub Copilot (Optional)

1. In the Extensions view, search for `GitHub Copilot`.
2. Install the extension. Note that GitHub Copilot is a paid service, though a free trial may be available.

## Step 5: Create a Jupyter Notebook

1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS).
2. Type and select `Jupyter: Create New Blank Notebook`.
3. A new Jupyter Notebook will open.

## Step 6: Utilize GitHub Copilot

Start typing Python code in the notebook cells. GitHub Copilot may suggest code completions and solutions based on the context.

## Step 7: Running Code Cells

1. Click the play button (`▶️`) next to a cell to run it.
2. The output will display directly below the cell.
