# Effective GitHub Copilot Prompts

Effective GitHub Copilot prompts are those that clearly convey the task at hand, incorporating necessary details and context to guide the AI in generating the most accurate and useful code suggestions. Here are some examples of well-crafted prompts that have been known to yield good results:

## Creating a New Function
- **Prompt:** 
  ```markdown
  Write a Python function named `calculate_area` that takes two arguments, `length` and `width`, and returns the area of a rectangle.
  ```
- **Effectiveness:** This prompt is clear and specific, detailing the programming language, function name, arguments, and the expected outcome.

## Fixing a Bug
- **Prompt:** 
  ```markdown
  Debug the following JavaScript function to correctly calculate and return the factorial of a number.
  ```
- **Effectiveness:** It directs GitHub Copilot to focus on debugging, providing a clear objective, especially effective when the problematic code is included.

## Adding a Feature
- **Prompt:** 
  ```markdown
  Modify the existing `sortList` function in Java to sort the list in descending order and include error handling for null input values.
  ```
- **Effectiveness:** The prompt communicates the desired modification, specific function to be altered, and additional requirements clearly.

## Generating Documentation
- **Prompt:** 
  ```markdown
  Generate comprehensive JSDoc comments for the `authenticateUser` function in this JavaScript file, including parameters and return values.
  ```
- **Effectiveness:** Asking for specific documentation (JSDoc) with details on parameters and return values guides Copilot to produce useful comments.

## Converting Code Between Languages
- **Prompt:** 
  ```markdown
  Translate this Python code snippet into equivalent Rust code, ensuring similar functionality and efficiency.
  ```
- **Effectiveness:** This prompt sets clear expectations for language translation and emphasizes the importance of maintaining functionality and efficiency.
