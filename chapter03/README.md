# Chapter 03: Code Refactoring

There are various ways to refactor code using Copilot.

## Types of refactoring
- Outdated APIs
- Complex code
- Broken code
- Inefficient code


---
## Open a file in the IDE

- Open the following file: 
[election_results.py](./03.01.1/lab/election_results.py)


## Asking for general recommendations
We can start by asking general recomendations from Copilot
Open: [data.csv](./03.01.2/lab/StudentGradeCalculator.java)

```text
// create csv data for 'id, name, phone' with 10 rows of data
// inline autocomplete works for the csv file: type `id` and press tab to autocomplete the header
```
